# Launcher Plugin Specification

This repository is for the definition and discussion of the Launcher Plugin Specification (LPS).  

The specification itself which is linked below has all the information about the idea and goal behind it.

Currently there is no known implementation of the specification yet, besides experimenting and feedback, it might be worth waiting for the first version to be finalized.

If you have an idea on how to improve this specification which is currently in a provisional version 0.1, or want to support it in your launcher or plugin, please open an issue with as much information as possible or contact me using my username in google's 2nd popular domain.
