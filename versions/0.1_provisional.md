# Provisional version 0.1 of the Launcher Plugin Specification.

This is a provisional document, feel free to open issues for discussion regarding parts you think are wrong or missing for a final version of the specification.

The goal for version 0.1 is to get the basic required framework for a generic launcher / plugin relationships that can be extended in a non breaking way in future minor versions updates.

## Why ?

There are many launcher type applications, each usually come with it's own plugin system which limits the ecosystem to whatever it's creator or community manages to produce and also limits it to the language the launcher is written in. 

The idea behind this specification is to make plugins which run in a different process with a unified protocol.

For the launcher developers this would allow tapping into a greater ecosystem and out-of-process plugins can increase stability.

For the plugin developers this will allow them to implement their idea once in their favorite language.

In the future there could be generic wrappers for the most popular languages / frameworks for implementing the specification.

A meta-plugin can also be created for launchers which do not support this specification.

## Compatibility

The specification tries to be comprehensive regarding the required features for having a good launcher experience.

Either side is allowed to ignore messages (or part of their contents) it does not support, however consideration should be taken regards how it effects the overall experience.

While the protocol might look overwhelming at start, please read the Flow section to see how most of it can be shimmed away for a simple variant.

## The big picture

1. The launcher reads the metadata.json file from the plugin directory.

2. The launcher starts a server for the given transport to talk to the plugin (A transport can be a socket, pipe, stdio, etc...).

3. The launcher executes the plugin process, passing arguments for the transport connection information.

4. Once the connection is established the launcher and plugin talk in the protocol described below until the launcher decides to end the plugin process.

5. The protocol is an exchange of asynchronous messages that are communicated between the processes in response to previous messages as described later in the specification.

## The message format

Each message is a combination of headers (HTTP) and body (JSON-RPC 2.0).

### Headers

Headers are implemented exactly like the HTTP Headers specification.

Each header is a 'key: value' ascii encoded string ended with a windows newline '\r\n' and the headers end with an empty '\r\n' line.

Each message must pass a Content-Length key with the value being the number of bytes the body has. Currently, no other headers are supported.

### Body

The body is UTF-8 JSON encoded by the [JSON-RPC 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-RPC#Version_2.0) specification. To facilitate asynchronous updates, currently all the messages are encoded as notifications, not request / response pairs. Each message body is a object with 3 keys:

name | type | description
---|:---:|---
jsonrpc | string | always set to 2.0
method | string | the name of the message being sent in lower case
params | array \| object | the message parameters described below

* a JSON / JavaScript object is a mapping / dictionary in other languages.

### Example Message

```json
Content-Length:97\r\n
\r\n
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "helloserver", 
    "params": {
        "name": "Generic Launcher Implementation",
        "apiversions": ["v0.1"]
    }
}
```

## Error handling

* In case of a protocol error (invalid method or invalid params for a method) the recipient should send an error message back as described below.

* In case of an I/O error in the transport between the processes, the plugin can retry and reconnect to the launcher which should discard previous results and send the last known request.

* In case of an crash of the plugin, or bad behavior such as spam, or failure in the handshake process, the launcher should disable the plugin until the user manually re-enables it.

## Messages

Each message is a JSON-RPC 2.0 notification that is initiated by the Launcher or the Plugin. All the communication after the HelloServer and HelloClient messages handshake is asynchronous in its nature.

### HelloServer (Launcher)

method: helloserver  
params: helloserverparams object

helloserverparams object  

name | type | description
---|:---:|---
name | string | The launcher name and version
apiversions | array[string] | The API versions supported

This should be the first message sent after the transport connection is established.

### HelloClient (Plugin)

method: helloclient  
params: helloclientparams object

helloclientparams object  

name | type | description
---|:---:|---
name | string | The plugin name and version
apiversion | string | The selected API version

This should be the second message in response to HelloServer, selecting the supported api version of the plugin.

### Error (Both)

method: error  
params: errorparams object

errorparams object

name | type | description
---|:---:|---
method | string | The method which had a problem
message | string | A message describing the error

This should be sent whenever an unexpected message or parameter was encountered.

### Request (Launcher)

method: request  
params: requestparams object

requestparams object

name | type | description
---|:---:|---
id | string | A unique id for this request
text | string | The text entered in the search field

This should be sent typically when the launcher has received a previously EntriesFinished (or if no request has yet to be sent) and deemed that a new request should be sent.

The id is a means to tell apart different EntriesFinished replies, since the protocol is asynchronous, a plugin might sent an EntriesFinsihed before knowing the launcher has already sent another request.

### EntriesAdd (Plugin)

method: entriesadd  
params: array[entry]

entry object  

name | type | description
---|:---:|---
id | string | A unique id for this entry
text | string | The text to be displayed in the list
score | number | A number between 0 and 1 for sorting
subtext | string | subtext for the entry
icon | string | [Data URI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs) for image
image | string | [Data URI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs) for image
link | string | A link URI (can be to a local file or http)
html | string | [Data URI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs) for html
subentries | array[entry] | sub entries
top | string | true or false for making this in the top of the results

Populate results in the launcher. This message can be sent multiple times per request. Also this message can be used to update previous entries by sending the same id.

Subentries should be displayed in accordance with the GUI layout of the launcher. If it's a two column, they can show up on the right side. If it's a one column, they can show up directly under their parent entry or be shown with a special interaction on the parent entry.

* image can be used for showing clipboard images for example
* file links are for quick preview if supported
* subentries can be rendered as different items in one-column launchers
* subentries are not to be recursive

### EntriesFinished (Plugin)

method: EntriesFinished  
params: string

This message signals the launcher that there are no more results for the request sent with the id as the params.

### EntriesRemove (Plugin)

method: entriesremove  
params: array[string]

Remove previous entries added by EntriesAdd by their id.

### EntriesRemoveAll (Plugin)

method: entriesremoveall  
params: null

Remove all previously added entries.

### EntrySelect (Launcher)

method: entryselect  
params: string

Cause the plugin to act on a select of a previously added entry by it's id

### Shutdown (Launcher)

method: shutdown  
params: null

Cause the plugin to do cleanup and close the transport.

## Flow

While the protocol is pretty flexible with the asynchronous updating flow, both sides can easily turn it into a single one shot synchronous flow if they don't require something more flexible:

### Plugin implementing a single one shot synchronous flow (even if the launcher doesn't)

1. Receive an Request message, keep it's Id.

2. Send an EntriesRemoveAll to the launcher.

3. Calculate the result.

4. Send an EntriesAdd with the results

5. Send an EntriesFinished with the Request id.

6. Goto #1

### Launcher implementing a single on shot synchronous flow to the GUI (even if the plugin doesn't)

1. Send an Request message

2. Keep a temporary object with previous results since last EntriesRemoveAll.

3. Populate and update the temporary object with EntriesAdd and EntriesRemove and EntriesRemoveAll messages from the plugin.

4. Wait for EntriesFinished with the Request id, and only then update the GUI.

5. Goto #1

* The asynchronous way is that each Entries message from the plugin should update it's GUI representation immediately.

### Ordering of entries

1. By the score each entry has. Entry without score should have a default score of 0.0 .

2. For entries with the same score, the order that the entries are received top to bottom in an array result, and older on top for multiple results.

3. It is up to the launcher to decide if to sort results per plugin or globally (While trying to respect the top field in an entry).

### Flow remarks

1. Both sides should process the incoming messages in the order they are received.

2. Both sides should not spam the other side with unneeded messages. (The launcher can wait some timeout for keyboard inactivity before sending a request, The plugin can do the same before starting to process the request, to look out for more requests).

3. An empty Request text should send the plugin to idle mode and send back a EntriesRemoveAll message.

4. The plugin should always send a EntriesFinished when it knows it will not send any more results to a given Request it encountered (even if it skips it because there is a newer one).

## Metadata.json file

This file, named metadata.json, is a JSON document that has everything needed by the launcher to know if and how to launch and talk to the plugin that lives in the same directory as the metadata.json file.

metadata object  

name | type | description
---|:---:|---
information | informationmetadataobject | Information for discovery and enumeration display
os | array[string] | Operating system support
requirements | array[string] | Which external dependencies are needed to run the plugin
transports | array[string] | Which transports can the plugin talk with
command | array[string] | How to run the plugin

informationmetadataobject object  

name | type | description
---|:---:|---
name | string | name of the plugin, should be unique
version | string | version of the plugin
description | string | description of what the plugin does
author | string | author of the plugin
url | string | homepage of the plugin
keywords | array[string] | list of discovery keywords

the os key should exist if the plugin is cross-platform on any OS. Otherwise, it should include which platforms it supports. Since the launcher should list only supported platforms, the valid keys should be "windows", "linux", "macos".

the requirements key, should exist if the plugin needs external dependencies such as "python2", "python3", "nodejs".

the command key is an array of arguments to execute the plugin process, where the special keys should be replaced with: ${TRANSPORT} with the selected transport (socket/unix) and ${TRANSPORT_ADDRESS} with the address to try connecting too, such as "localhost:1234" (socket) or "/tmp/pluginsock.1" (unix).

### Example metadata.json file

```json
{
    "information": {
        "name": "l33t calculator",
        "version": "1.0",
        "description": "I can calculate!",
        "author": "mario",
        "url": "http://calcaultor.l33t/",
        "keywords": ["calculator", "scientific-calculator"]
    },
    "os": [
        "windows",
        "macos"
    ],
    "requirements": [
        "python3",
    ],
    "transports": [
        "socket",
        "unix"
    ],
    "command": [
        "python3",
        "calculator_plugin.py",
        "${TRANSPORT}://${TRANSPORT_ADDRESS}"
    ]
}
```

## Miscellaneous

* A list of things I should be should be open for discussion in later versions of the specification:

  * An option for EntrySelect to specify secondary triggers for entry (such as right click, key press, on focus, etc...).

  * An option for the plugin to control aspects of the launcher such as the text box

  * Add synchronous commands for setting and getting configuration for the plugin (the config should be passed as a json object), this can help with running multiple versions of the plugin by different launchers.

  * Support for stable ids that dont change for the same entry in different calls, this can help mostly with vote counting for score boosting by the launchers that support it.

* I think that helper functions such as copy to clipboard, execute an app, open a file, find in finder, should exist as a helper framework that sits in the plugin code and not directly related to this specification.

## Open issues for this version

* Can this specification be used to use the plugins for non launchers usage style, such as from command line (in a unified way), etc ?

* Should it be enforced in the specification to not allow more then one concurrent request ?

* Are there loose ends / ambiguous definitions or flows in the specification ?

* What transports to support out of the box ?

* What is the license for this specification ?
